                    In Engineering Education, Laboratories are the link between
                    theoretical and practical knowledge. A Civil Engineering
                    Laboratory has been established by BIHE in order to cater
                    for the full breadth and depth of Bachelor of Civil
                    Engineering program.

                    The survey equipment in this lab is used for surveying
                    exercises and is equipped with all latest instrumentation
                    viz levels, total stations, and GPS receivers sets for
                    conducting ground surveying works.
