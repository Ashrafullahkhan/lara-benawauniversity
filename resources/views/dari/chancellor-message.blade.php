            <p>
              After over 4 years of building a solid foundation of high quality
              engineering and computer science education and research, at the
              Undergraduate level, Benawa Institute of Higher Education (BIHE)
              is embarking on a journey to reach the next level of excellence.
              It aims to not just produce high class engineers and computer
              scientists but professionals and change agents. These agents of
              change other than being better human beings and better citizens of
              our beloved country Afghanistan, would be ready to tackle the
              problems that beset our country with leadership, ingenuity and the
              highest level of moral and ethical values.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would like to welcome the studentsâ€™ of 2017 intake to the BIHE
              family. I am sure that the four years that they spend at this
              institute will be professionally enriching and enjoyable and they
              would remember these years throughout their life.
