                    Student Affairs Office is an integral component of student
                    life on campus. It is a division of service and support to
                    enhance student growth and development. In other words, it
                    is a helpful friend of students even before they are
                    admitted to BIHE as freshmen and sustains that relationship
                    even after graduation as alumni of BIHE.

                    Students joining degree courses are assigned 'Advisors' who
                    are members of the faculty. Normally, these
                    appointments/meetings take place throughout the entire
                    period of student's stay at BIHE unless a change becomes
                    necessary due to departure of the faculty member or for
                    balancing the Advisor's load.
